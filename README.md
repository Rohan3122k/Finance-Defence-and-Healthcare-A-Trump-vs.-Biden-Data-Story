# Finance Defence and Healthcare : A Trump vs. Biden Data Story
Project Description: 

This project provides a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of three critical sectors - Finance, Defense, and Healthcare , under the administrations of Donald Trump and Joe Biden. By leveraging a robust dataset of 10,542 APIs, this study explores the economic and policy implications of the Trump presidency, particularly in light of his victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

Objective: 
The primary goal of this project is to examine the evolution of the economic and social landscape within these sectors during the Trump and Biden administrations. Through sentiment analysis, data visualization, and comparative analysis of key metrics, the study seeks to uncover insights into how these sectors were shaped by the policies of both administrations.

Key Components: 
Sentiment Analysis
The sentiment analysis component focused on social media data relating to the U.S. economy, defense policies, and healthcare employment, spanning the period from July 1 to November 30, 2024. TextBlob, a natural language processing tool, was used to analyze 10,542 APIs, classifying sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. Additionally, sentiment word clouds were created for each sector to visualize the most frequently used keywords and their emotional connotations.

Sectoral Analysis

Finance: The analysis of public sentiment surrounding Donald Trump aimed to gauge market perceptions during both the Trump and Biden administrations. A comparative study of key economic metrics, including GDP performance and unemployment rates, was conducted to provide insights into economic trends, shifts, and their broader implications under each administration.


Defense: This component analyzed government spending on defense, along with sentiment data surrounding defense policies, while evaluating stock trends for major defense companies. The study specifically focused on defense budgets, identifying fiscal priorities, and contrasting the approaches of the Trump and Biden administrations in this critical area.


Healthcare: Employment trends within the healthcare sector were examined, alongside public sentiment and stock trends for major healthcare companies. This analysis provided valuable insights into the sectorâ€™s growth, challenges, and workforce trends, helping to understand the broader impact of administrative policies on the industry.

This project presents a thorough examination of shifts in public sentiment, economic metrics, and policy priorities across two distinct U.S. administrations. The findings provide valuable insights into the influence of both Trump and Biden's policies on the finance, defense, and healthcare sectors, highlighting how their leadership has shaped key aspects of the U.S. economy and society.
